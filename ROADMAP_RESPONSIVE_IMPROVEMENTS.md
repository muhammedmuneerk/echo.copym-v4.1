## Files Updated

### 1. `src/pages/Roadmap/Roadmap.jsx`
**Main Roadmap Component**

#### Responsive Improvements:
- ✅ **Grid Layout**: Changed from `lg:grid-cols-2` to `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2` for proper mobile stacking

  - Headers: `text-2xl sm:text-3xl lg:text-4xl`
  - Descriptions: `text-base sm:text-lg`
- ✅ **Container Spacing**: Maintained responsive padding and margins
- ✅ **Side-by-side Layout**: Properly stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop

### 2. `src/pages/Roadmap/sections/RWARoadmap.jsx`
**Issuer Journey Timeline Component**

#### Responsive Improvements:
- ✅ **Dual Layout System**: 
  - **Desktop**: Traditional side-alternating timeline with central line
  - **Mobile**: Vertical timeline with left-aligned dots and cards
- ✅ **Timeline Line**: 
  - Desktop: `hidden lg:block` central line
  - Mobile: `lg:hidden` left-aligned line at `left-6`
- ✅ **Scrolling Ball**: Hidden on mobile (`hidden lg:block`)
- ✅ **Content Cards**: 
  - Desktop: Fixed positioning with `mr-20/ml-20` margins
  - Mobile: Flexible layout with `flex-1 max-w-none`
- ✅ **Timeline Dots**: 
  - Desktop: Centered with `left-1/2 translate-x-1/2`
  - Mobile: Left-aligned with `mr-6 mt-4`
- ✅ **Spacing**: Added `mb-8 lg:mb-0` for mobile card spacing

### 3. `src/pages/Roadmap/sections/InvestorRoadmap.jsx`
**Investor Journey Timeline Component**

#### Responsive Improvements:
